## **Cruxfade-Micro Core Loop (Locked Down)**

**1. Enter Grid**

* Start in center tile.
* Tiles are dark except visited ones.
* 4x4 map, randomized but weighted for a set number of events.
* First tile in each new grid is a **safe room** (heal/buff/shop/etc.).

**2. Explore**

* Move to adjacent tiles, revealing them.
* Tile events can be:

  * **Fight** (stats + skills roll)
  * **Hazard** (choose best party member)
  * **Item/Equipment** (buffs stats directly — no inventory bloat)
  * **Ally** (joins party, merges deck, keeps buffs)
  * **Key** (required for exit)
  * **Door** (exit to next grid)

**3. Deck & Cards**

* Hard cap **5 cards** (skills/abilities).
* Equipment doesn’t take card space, modifies stats directly.
* Deck merges with allies’ cards.
* Discard rules apply when exceeding cap.

**4. Encounters**

* **Normal fights/hazards**: only the **party leader** participates.
* **Boss fights**: multi-phase.

  1. Mini-encounters (limbs, hazards, minions).
  2. Boss fights entire party in final phase.

**5. Stat Rolls**

* Mostly simple fixed dice for speed (d6/d20).
* Skills add modifiers or swap die size depending on effect.
* Fight resolution is quick: pop-up overlay, roll animation, outcome.

**6. Between Grids**

* Party & buffs persist.
* Map is fully reshuffled each grid.
* Lose allies/items via certain events.

**7. Endgame**

* Grids → Boss fight.
* If party leader dies, you keep going with other members.
* If all die, run ends.
