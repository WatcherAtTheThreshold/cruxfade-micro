# Cruxfade-Micro: Allies.json Implementation Handoff

## üéâ **SESSION ACCOMPLISHMENTS**

### ‚úÖ **Encounter Cards System Complete**
Successfully implemented beautiful encounter cards for combat encounters:

**Visual Features:**
- **Two-card combat display**: Player card (blue) vs Enemy card (red)
- **Turn-based highlighting**: Active player's card glows with colored border
- **Health color coding**: HP changes from green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí red as damage accumulates
- **Enemy type icons**: Emoji fallbacks for all enemy types (goblin üë∫, orc üßå, dragon üêâ, etc.)

**Technical Implementation:**
- `createPlayerEncounterCard()` - Generates player combat card HTML
- `createEnemyEncounterCard()` - Generates enemy combat card HTML with type-specific icons
- `getEnemyIcon()` - Maps enemy types to appropriate emoji icons
- Cards automatically update with HP changes, turn switches, and combat state

### ‚úÖ **Button Placement Problem Solved**
Fixed critical UX issue where action buttons were pushed off-screen:

**Solution: Inline Action Buttons**
- Moved buttons from separate `#encounter-actions` area to inside encounter content
- Added `.encounter-inline-actions` CSS class for proper positioning
- Updated event delegation to listen on entire `.encounters` section
- Applied to all encounter types (Fight, Door, Key, Item) for consistency

**Result:** Buttons always visible and properly positioned below encounter content

### ‚úÖ **Full Card Backgrounds System**
Implemented complete card background image support:

**CSS Implementation:**
```css
.encounter-card.player-card {
    background-image: url('./images/cards/hero-card-bg.png');
    background-size: 100% 100%;
}
.encounter-card.enemy-card {
    background-image: url('./images/cards/monster-card-bg.png');
    background-size: 100% 100%;
}
```

**Design Specs:**
- Card dimensions: 180px √ó 220px
- Built-in text areas for portraits, names, HP, stats
- Different backgrounds for player vs enemy cards
- Graceful fallback to solid colors if images missing

### ‚úÖ **Boss/General Portrait System**
Prepared epic boss encounter visuals:

**Smart Portrait Detection:**
- `getEnemyPortraitPath()` function detects encounter type
- `/images/bosses/` folder for final boss portraits  
- `/images/generals/` folder for boss minions/lieutenants
- Automatic fallback to regular `/images/enemies/` folder

**Ready-to-Use File Names:**
```
/images/bosses/
    shadow-lord-final.png
    crystal-tyrant-final.png
    void-empress-final.png

/images/generals/
    crystal-guardian.png
    void-spawn.png
    void-wraith.png
```

## üéØ **NEXT PRIORITY: Allies.json Implementation**

### **Goal: Data-Driven Allies with Procedural Naming**

Replace the current hardcoded `recruitRandomAlly()` system with a flexible JSON-based approach that includes:

1. **Procedural naming system** - "Marcus the Warrior", "Celeste the Mage"
2. **Regional ally theming** - Forest vs Mountain vs Void survivors
3. **Data-driven stats and cards** - Easy balancing without code changes
4. **Clean code architecture** - Remove hardcoded ally logic from state.js

### **Proposed allies.json Structure**
```json
{
  "forest-region": {
    "warrior": {
      "names": ["Marcus", "Elena", "Thorin", "Lyra"],
      "titles": ["the Brave", "the Stalwart", "the Forest Guardian"],
      "baseStats": { "hp": 12, "maxHp": 12, "atk": 4, "mag": 0 },
      "tags": ["human", "warrior"],
      "cards": [
        { "id": "shield-bash", "name": "Shield Bash", "type": "attack" },
        { "id": "defensive-stance", "name": "Defensive Stance", "type": "defense" }
      ],
      "rarity": "common",
      "joinConditions": { "minGridLevel": 1, "maxPartySize": 4 }
    },
    "mage": {
      "names": ["Celeste", "Sage", "Willow", "Rowan"],
      "titles": ["the Wise", "the Mystic", "the Grove Keeper"],
      "baseStats": { "hp": 8, "maxHp": 8, "atk": 1, "mag": 4 },
      "tags": ["human", "mage"],
      "cards": [
        { "id": "magic-bolt", "name": "Magic Bolt", "type": "attack" },
        { "id": "heal", "name": "Heal", "type": "utility" }
      ]
    }
  },
  "mountain-region": {
    "warrior": {
      "names": ["Kael", "Vera", "Stone", "Peak"],
      "titles": ["the Mountain-Born", "the Unbreakable", "the Stone-Heart"],
      "baseStats": { "hp": 14, "maxHp": 14, "atk": 5, "mag": 0 }
    }
  },
  "void-region": {
    "scout": {
      "names": ["Ash", "Void", "Echo", "Shadow"],
      "titles": ["the Survivor", "the Lost", "the Void-Touched"],
      "baseStats": { "hp": 10, "maxHp": 10, "atk": 3, "mag": 2 }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Key Implementation Functions Needed**

**1. Name Generation System:**
```javascript
function generateAllyName(region, allyType, allyData) {
    const names = allyData.names || ["Unknown"];
    const titles = allyData.titles || ["the Wanderer"];
    const name = pickRandom(names);
    const title = pickRandom(titles);
    return `${name} ${title}`;
}
```

**2. Region-Aware Recruitment:**
```javascript
function getRegionForGrid(gridLevel) {
    if (gridLevel <= 5) return "forest-region";
    if (gridLevel <= 10) return "mountain-region";  
    return "void-region";
}
```

**3. Data-Driven Ally Creation:**
```javascript
function createAllyFromData(region, allyType) {
    const allyData = GAME_DATA.allies[region][allyType];
    const ally = {
        id: `${allyType}-${Date.now()}`,
        name: generateAllyName(region, allyType, allyData),
        ...allyData.baseStats,
        tags: [...allyData.tags],
        cards: [...allyData.cards]
    };
    return ally;
}
```

## üìÅ **CURRENT WORKING STATE**

### **Files Modified and Working:**
- **ui.js**: Encounter cards, inline buttons, boss portrait system
- **styles.css**: Card backgrounds, inline action styling, encounter card layouts
- **state.js**: Enemy type preservation for cards
- **All JSON data files**: Loading system working perfectly

### **Event System:**
- Event delegation updated to handle inline buttons
- All encounter actions (Fight, Flee, Take Item, etc.) working properly
- Boss encounters compatible with new card system

### **Visual Assets Ready:**
- Hero card backgrounds implemented
- Monster card backgrounds implemented  
- Boss/general portrait folder structure prepared
- Enemy emoji fallback system complete

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Current Ally System (To Replace):**
Located in `state.js` around line 1200:
- `recruitRandomAlly()` - Hardcoded ally templates
- `getAllyCards()` - Hardcoded card mappings
- Manual party size and card overflow handling

### **Data Loading System (Already Working):**
Located in `main.js`:
- `loadGameData()` loads all JSON files with error handling
- `setGameData()` makes data available throughout game
- Graceful fallback when files missing

### **Integration Points:**
- **Ally recruitment**: Replace hardcoded logic with JSON-driven
- **Card overflow**: Keep existing system, works with any cards
- **Party management**: No changes needed to existing leadership/dismissal
- **Equipment system**: Already handles dynamic party members

---

## üéÆ **TESTING CHECKLIST**

When allies.json implementation is complete:

**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Allies recruit with procedural names ("Marcus the Brave")
- [ ] Regional variation works (Forest vs Mountain vs Void allies)
- [ ] Stats and cards load from JSON data
- [ ] Card overflow system works with JSON-defined cards
- [ ] Party leadership switching works with named allies
- [ ] Equipment system works with procedurally named allies

**Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Missing allies.json file doesn't break game
- [ ] Invalid region defaults gracefully
- [ ] Empty name/title arrays handled
- [ ] Party size limits respected
- [ ] Ally dismissal removes JSON-defined cards properly

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Ally names feel natural and varied
- [ ] Regional theming is apparent
- [ ] No duplicate names in same party (if desired)
- [ ] Ally cards integrate smoothly with existing hand management

---

## üöÄ **SUCCESS METRICS**

**Immediate Goals:**
- ‚úÖ Remove all hardcoded ally logic from `recruitRandomAlly()`
- ‚úÖ Allies appear with procedural names: "Elena the Forest Guardian"  
- ‚úÖ Regional theming visible: Forest names vs Mountain names
- ‚úÖ JSON-driven stats and cards working
- ‚úÖ Existing card/party systems unchanged

**Long-term Benefits:**
- üé® Easy content expansion through JSON editing
- ‚öñÔ∏è Simple stat balancing without code changes  
- üåç Rich regional storytelling through themed names
- üé≤ High replayability through name variety
- üßπ Clean, maintainable codebase

## üìã **READY TO START**

The foundation is solid, the cards look amazing, and the data-driven architecture is proven. Time to bring those generic allies to life with names, stories, and regional flavor!

**First step:** Design the allies.json structure and create a basic implementation for forest region warriors and mages. üå≤‚öîÔ∏è‚ú®
